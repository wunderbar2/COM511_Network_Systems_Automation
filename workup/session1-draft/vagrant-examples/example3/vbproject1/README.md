# Setting up two virtual machines 

This configuration sets up two virtual machines based upon the [masterAlma10Box](../../example3/masterAlma10box)

Having configured the second ethnernet connection using

```
     alma_1.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--nic2", "hostonly"]
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--hostonlyadapter2", "VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter"] #use proper network name here
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cableconnected2", "on"]
     end
```

We need to change its configuration from DHCP to a static address using nmcli

```

     # set eth 1 to a static ip address below DHCP range of virtual box
     alma_1.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
       echo script setting static ip address 
       nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 2"  ipv4.method manual   ipv4.addresses 192.168.56.10/24
       nmcli connection down "Wired connection 2"
       nmcli connection up "Wired connection 2"
     SHELL
```

An extra script is injected into the machine which can be done to clone this repo in the machine to run as an example

The [additional-config.sh](../additional-config.sh) file should be run within the virtual machine using 

```
sh /vagrant/additional-config.sh
```

Note that `vagrant halt` may not work on these machines because of a problem with shutting down the guest additions. 
`shutdown now` may also not complete.
This is a known problem. 
You may need to manually stop the machines in the VirtualBox gui.
Make sure you backup your work to github because you may need to destroy and recreate these machines.
